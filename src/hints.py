hints.py  ·  gentle nudges for a student who's stuck, shared by both testers

Two sources, checked in order (see hint_for() and grade_exercise() in both
examshell.py's):

  1. A curated hint on the exercise itself (bank entry's optional "hint"
     key) — hand-written, exercise-specific, added incrementally over
     time. Preferred when present. It's either:
       - a plain string, shown for every failure on that exercise, or
       - a dict keyed by the same category names classify() returns
         (plus an optional "default"), so one exercise can nudge a crash,
         a leak and a plain wrong answer differently — e.g. ft_split can
         say "you're missing the NULL terminator slot" for a crash but
         "your word count doesn't match your extraction logic" otherwise.
  2. diagnose() below — a generic, pattern-matched guess from the shape of
     the failure alone (works for every exercise immediately, curated or
     not). It only ever *suggests* ("could be", "often means") — it has
     no idea what the student's code actually does, so it's wrong often
     enough that a confident tone would be actively misleading.

Both are surfaced only after STUCK_THRESHOLD *consecutive* fails on the
same exercise (see stats.consecutive_fails) — not on every red result.
A student who fails once just made a mistake; a student who fails three
times in a row on the same thing is stuck, and that's the moment a small
push helps instead of feeling like nagging. Never shown during --exam
(see both examshell.py's grade_exercise) — confronting a stuck moment
without a crutch is part of what the exam is actually testing, and the
practice/training modes are where this tool is supposed to build that
muscle instead of short-circuiting it.
