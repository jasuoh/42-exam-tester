# Changelog

Notable changes to this project, newest entries first. This tracks the
*tester itself* (grading logic, exercise banks, UX) — not students'
`rendu/` solutions. Loosely follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/);
this repo has no version numbers, so entries are grouped by date instead.

## Unreleased

### Added
- **Achievements** (`src/achievements.py`, shared by both testers) — 10
  badges (First Blood, Perfectionist, Comeback Kid, Redemption, Full
  Coverage, Night Owl, Early Bird, Century, Exam Cleared, Flawless Exam),
  each a pure function of the student's own `stats.jsonl` history —
  nothing new is persisted. A newly-earned badge is announced the moment
  it happens (after any `--grade`/practice/train/exam call, not just at
  exam completion); `--stats` now shows the full roster, earned and
  locked, with a description of how to unlock each one. This replaces
  and generalizes the old ad-hoc "First full clear!" / "Flawless — no
  retries" logic that lived duplicated in both `examshell.py`'s and only
  ever showed at the very end of a full exam run.
- Colour-coded pass-rate bars in `--stats`'s per-exercise table (green
  solid / yellow shaky / red struggling), sorted worst-first — it
  previously showed bare "N/M passed" text despite the bar primitive
  already existing elsewhere in `ui.py`.
- A live spinner while grading is in progress (`ui.spinner()`, wraps the
  blocking `grader.grade()` call) — compiling a C exercise, running a
  big fuzz batch, or an optional valgrind pass can take a few seconds
  with zero prior feedback; now there's a visible "still working" signal
  instead of a silent wait. Plain (non-rich) terminals keep the old
  static note, since there's no live terminal control worth building for
  a single line there.
- Curated `"hint"` text for all 20 Python `TRAINING_EXERCISES` entries,
  which previously had none — each nudges toward the exercise's actual
  technique or gotcha (e.g. the two-pointer trick, which DP recurrence
  to use, why a greedy approach fails) instead of falling back to
  `hints.diagnose()`'s generic, exercise-blind guess.
- `LICENSE` (MIT) and `[project]` metadata in `pyproject.toml` (name,
  version, description, license, author, dependencies) — the repo had
  neither, which for a public GitHub repo defaults to "all rights
  reserved" regardless of visibility. README gets a license badge and a
  short License section to match.
- A one-line legend (`e=easy · m=medium · h=hard · w=weak · a=all`)
  under the training-pool table in both testers — the filter keys were
  only ever shown bare in the prompt ("e/m/h/w to filter") with no
  explanation of what they stood for.
- `--train weak` (both testers, plus a 'w' key next to e/m/h in the
  interactive training picker) — drills the training exercises you've
  actually gotten wrong at least once, worst-first (an active fail streak
  ranks above a merely-imperfect lifetime pass rate). New `stats.
  weakest_exercises()`: excludes both an exercise you've never touched
  and one with a spotless record — the queue is exactly "things worth
  reviewing," nothing more, nothing less.
- `--strict` (both testers) — shorthand for every `--strict-*` flag at
  once, i.e. the harshest grading each tester can do. On the C side this
  also turns on `--valgrind` itself (`--strict-valgrind` alone has
  nothing to check otherwise).
- `--diff` flag (both testers) — on a failing test, shows the full
  expected/got values instead of the usual 70-character clip, plus a
  pointer at the first character where they diverge (a caret line in
  the plain-text UI, a reverse-video highlight on the diverging tail in
  the rich UI). Useful once a value is long enough that eyeballing two
  side-by-side reprs stops working. New pure helper: `ui.first_diff_index()`.
- `--diff` now also shows the student's own submitted function next to a
  failing test, syntax-highlighted (a `rich.syntax.Syntax` panel, or a
  dimmed plain-text block with a `── your f() ──`-style header when rich
  isn't available) — so you can see your code and the mismatch without
  alt-tabbing to your editor. Shown once per report, not once per
  failure, and — unlike `hints.py`'s stuck-student nudges — never
  suppressed during `--exam`: it's just the student's own code, already
  open in their editor, not a crutch. New `extract_function_source()` in
  both `src/grader.py` (ast-based) and `c_exam/grader.py` (best-effort
  brace-matching over the comment/string-stripped source, reusing
  `_strip_comments_and_strings()`); both return `None` on any failure
  (syntax error, function not found, unbalanced braces) rather than
  raising, since this is a purely cosmetic display.
- `--diff` now diffs a `list`/`tuple` `Failure` element-by-element instead
  of character-by-character once it has more than one element — "index 2:
  expected 3, got 4" is far more useful than "character 47 differs" once
  a value is a 20-item list. Same idea for a multi-line value (most often
  a C `CFailure`'s multi-line stdout): a `difflib`-based line diff instead
  of the flat char pointer. Both render as a small `-`/`+` block in place
  of the usual single-line pointer, in both the rich and plain UIs; a
  short scalar (a plain string, int, float, bool, or anything single-line)
  still gets the existing char-pointer treatment, unchanged. New pure
  helpers in `src/ui.py`: `structural_diff()`, `line_diff()`.
- `find_forbidden_calls()` in `src/grader.py` — an AST-based check, the
  Python-side counterpart to `c_exam/grader.py`'s existing `find_forbidden()`.
  Lets an exercise declare a `"forbidden"` tuple of names; grading fails
  immediately (no opt-in flag, unlike C's `--strict-forbidden`) if the
  submission calls any of them, since a forbidden call here means the
  student's solution outsources the one thing the exercise is testing.
- `py_cryptic_sorter` now sets `"forbidden": ("sorted", "sort")` — using
  Python's built-in sort defeats the point of the exercise (implement a
  stable multi-key ordering yourself). Its hint was rewritten to match:
  it now points at a hand-rolled insertion sort instead of `sorted(key=...)`.
- **Curated hints for the remaining 38 exam exercises.** Only 6 of the 44
  entries in the Python exam bank had a hand-written `"hint"`; a student
  stuck on any of the other 38 fell straight through to the generic,
  pattern-matched `hints.diagnose()` fallback, which has no idea what the
  exercise is actually about and is often unhelpful. Every exercise now
  carries a short, exercise-specific nudge grounded in its own spec and
  reference implementation (e.g. the empty-list/modulo-by-zero trap in
  `py_twist_sequence`, the `set()`-collapses-duplicates trap in
  `py_anagram`, the even-length-center gap in
  `py_longest_palindromic_substring`) — pointing at what to check, never
  handing over the solution.
- Curated `"hint"` entries for all 9 `c_exam/training_bank.py` exercises
  (`array_sum`, `find_max`, `is_palindrome_num`, `count_pairs_sum`,
  `kadane_max_sum`, `count_unique`, `lis_length`, `count_inversions`,
  `max_gap`) — previously none of them had one, so a stuck student only
  ever got `hints.diagnose()`'s generic pattern-matched guess. Each hint
  targets the actual technique or edge case for that exercise (e.g.
  Kadane's classic all-negative-array bug, the strictly-increasing
  comparison in `lis_length`'s DP, sorting a copy in `max_gap`).
  `lis_length` and `max_gap` (the two that `malloc`/`free`) get a
  crash/leak/default split like `ft_split`'s; the rest are plain strings.
- Curated `"hint"` entries for the 44 C exam exercises (`c_exam/bank.py`)
  that had none — every one of the 59 exercises now nudges a stuck student
  with something specific to what it actually does, instead of falling all
  the way through to `hints.diagnose()`'s generic, pattern-matched guess.
  41 are plain strings; 2 (`rev_wstr`, `rostring`) use a `"crash"`/`"leak"`/
  `"default"` dict split, since both extract words into per-word `malloc`'d
  buffers where a sizing bug and a missing `free` are genuinely different
  mistakes worth nudging differently.

### Fixed
- **`py_bracket_validator`** carried `"level": 1` while living in the
  `exam_bank.py` level-6 section — level 1's standard pool had 3 exercises
  instead of 2, and level 6's had only 1 (`whisper_cipher`), so a level-6
  exam run never actually randomized. Corrected to `"level": 6`.
- **`ft_split` / `pgcd` / `fprime`** (`c_exam/bank.py`) each had a
  `"forbidden"` list that contradicted their own subject's
  `Allowed functions` line *and* their own `oracle_c` — e.g. `ft_split`
  forbade `malloc` while its subject said `Allowed: malloc` and its
  reference solution called `malloc` three times. Every legitimate
  solution to these three exercises was getting a bogus forbidden-call
  warning. Removed the incorrect `"forbidden"` entries.
- **`hints.classify()` never recognized a Python per-case timeout**
  (`src/hints.py`). It checked `f.got == "[TIMEOUT]"` — the exact marker
  `c_exam/grader.py`'s program-kind path uses — but the Python sandbox's
  own per-case timeout marker is `"[TIMEOUT > Ns]"` (the timeout value is
  embedded in the string). Since that never matched, a Python student
  stuck on an infinite loop on just one input (the single most common
  real timeout shape) never got the "looks like an infinite loop" hint,
  even after `STUCK_THRESHOLD` consecutive fails — silently fell through
  to no hint at all. Changed to `str(f.got).startswith("[TIMEOUT")`,
  which matches both markers. Verified live: a solution that infinite-loops
  on one specific input now gets the hint on its 3rd consecutive failing
  grade.
- **Missing `malloc` NULL-checks** in five reference solutions —
  `ft_range`, `ft_rrange`, `ft_split` (`c_exam/bank.py`), `lis_length`,
  `max_gap` (`c_exam/training_bank.py`) all dereferenced the result of
  `malloc()` without checking it first. `ft_split` additionally now frees
  every word it already duplicated (and the pointer array itself) if a
  later `malloc` fails mid-loop — matching what its own "leak" hint has
  been telling students to do all along.
- **28 "program"-kind C exercises used `printf()` while their own subject
  said `Allowed functions: write`** (`add_prime_sum`, `alpha_mirror`,
  `camel_to_snake`, `count_vowels`, `epur_str`, `expand_str`, `first_word`,
  `fizzbuzz`, `hidenp`, `is_palindrome_str`, `last_word`, `longest_word_str`,
  `paramsum`, `print_hex`, `repeat_alpha`, `rev_print`, `rev_wstr`,
  `rostring`, `rot_13`, `rotone`, `rstr_capitalizer`, `search_and_replace`,
  `snake_to_camel`, `str_capitalizer`, `tab_mult`, `ulstr`, `union`,
  `wdmatch`). The grader only diffs stdout so this never affected grading
  correctness, but the reference/"answer key" implementation should model
  the exact constraint it's teaching. Rewrote all 28 to use raw `write(2)`
  calls (plus small self-contained per-exercise integer-to-write helpers
  for the 6 that print numbers), byte-for-byte identical output, verified
  against the bank's own curated + fuzz cases and a clean
  `-Wall -Wextra -Werror` compile.

## 2026-09-02 — PR #1 bug-hunt batch

- Fixed a batch of correctness bugs across the exam flow, hints, and C
  grading; follow-up pass fixed remaining review findings (bank defaults,
  hint accuracy, `--strict-forbidden`).
- README polish (hero section, feature showcase, collapsible tables).

## 2026-08-30 – 2026-08-31

- Added stuck-student hints, shared by both the Python and C testers.
- Added optional `--valgrind` leak checking to the C tester; fixed the
  grading harness's own memory leaks in list/voidlist/str_array exercises
  uncovered while building it.
- Added a GitHub Actions CI pipeline.
